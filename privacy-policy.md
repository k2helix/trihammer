# Privacy policy

We have a minimum-collection policy. Aside from essential data required to keep the service running, we are not collecting additional user or tracking data.

## Data stored

We don't share data with any third party, we only store it on our database service provider ([MongoDB](https://mongodb.com)) \
We don't store the content of any message, we just use it when it is sent if it is a command. \
Information we store:
- User ID, to identify users in our database.
- When someone sends a message, we store that that person has sent a message in a certain server. This is used for the xp/activity system.
- Information provided in commands that needs to be stored, such as the profile description of a user or the reason of a ban.
- Guild configuration: language, prefix, logs channels, administrator roles...
